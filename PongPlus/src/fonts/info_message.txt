Ping-Pong with a twist. 
The game follows the classic Ping-Pong rules where 
each player controls a paddle and tries to hit the 
ball past the opponent's paddle to score points. 
Every 3 points scored, a power-up appears on the ball. 
The power-up lasts for about 10-15 seconds. 
The player who scores the next point while the ball has 
the power-up gains the power-up for 10-15 seconds. 
After the power-up is activated, the ball returns to 
normal until the next power-up appears. 
Enjoy the game and may the best player win!
